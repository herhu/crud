To troubleshoot the encryption and decryption process with your current setup, let's manually test the endpoints using `curl`. This will help us ensure that the `EccService` is functioning correctly and the server is properly handling requests.

### 1. Start Your Server

You can start it with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 2. Test Endpoints with `curl`

We'll use `curl` to send HTTP requests to your server. Replace `localhost:3000` with your server's address if it's different.

#### Test POST /secret-notes

Create a new secret note.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/secret-notes \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"note": "This is a test note"}'
```

You should get a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "note": "encrypted_data_here",
  "ephemeralPublicKey": "public_key_here",
  "createdAt": "timestamp_here",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp_here"
}
```

#### Test GET /secret-notes/:id

Retrieve the decrypted note.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/secret-notes/1
```

You should get the decrypted note content:

```json
"This is a test note"
```

#### Test GET /secret-notes/:id/encrypted

Retrieve the encrypted note.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/secret-notes/1/encrypted
```

You should get the encrypted note content:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "note": "encrypted_data_here",
  "ephemeralPublicKey": "public_key_here",
  "createdAt": "timestamp_here",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp_here"
}
```

#### Test PUT /secret-notes/:id

Update the note.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/secret-notes/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"note": "This is an updated test note"}'
```

You should get the updated encrypted note content:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "note": "updated_encrypted_data_here",
  "ephemeralPublicKey": "public_key_here",
  "createdAt": "timestamp_here",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp_here"
}
```

#### Test DELETE /secret-notes/:id

Delete the note.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/secret-notes/1
```

You should get an empty response with status 200.

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly loaded and the `ECC_PRIVATE_KEY` and `ECC_PUBLIC_KEY` are correctly set. You can print these variables in your `EccService` to verify they are being loaded or generate runing:
```bash
ts-node generate-keys.ts
```

### 4. Check Logs

Look at the logs generated by your application to ensure there are no errors related to the environment variables or the encryption/decryption process.

### 5. Debugging

If any of the `curl` commands fail, check the error messages and logs to identify the problem. Ensure that the `iv`, `authTag`, and other parameters are correctly generated and parsed during encryption and decryption.

If the problem persists, provide the exact error messages and logs generated by your application, and I'll help you further diagnose and fix the issue.
